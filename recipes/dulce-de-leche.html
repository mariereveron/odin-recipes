        <p><strong>Dulce de leche</strong> is a creamy caramel-like sauce made from sweetened condensed milk and sugar, popular in Latin American countries. </br> Particularly popular in Argentina, where it is often used as a spread on toast or as a filling for cakes and pastries. </p>       
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can of sweetened condensed milk (14 oz or 396 g)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Fill a pot with water, making sure that the water level is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the can.</li>
        <li>Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Let the can simmer for 2-3 hours, making sure to add more water to the pot as needed to keep the can fully submerged.</li>
        <li>After 2-3 hours, turn off the heat and carefully remove the can from the pot using tongs or a slotted spoon. Let the can cool to room temperature before opening it.</li>
        <li>Once the can has cooled, open it and you'll find thick, creamy dulce de leche inside!</li> 
        </ol>
        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Be very careful when working with the can of condensed milk, as it can become extremely hot and can potentially explode if not fully submerged in water. <br> Always make sure to check the water level in the pot and add more water as needed to keep the can fully submerged.</em></p>
